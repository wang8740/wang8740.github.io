Welcome! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science at the University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Ali Anwar](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/ali-anwar). I am now working on the field of AI safety.  

I earned my Ph.D in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. This [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily
focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org).

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Economics and Finance, a Master's degree in Economics, both from Tsinghua University, 
  and a Master's degree in Statistics from the University of Minnesota. I love playing table tennis!
