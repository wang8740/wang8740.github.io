Welcome! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science at the University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Ali Anwar](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/ali-anwar). I am now working on the field of AI trustworthiness.  

Previously, I obtained a Master's degree in Statistics from the University of Minnesota, as well as a Master's and a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Tsinghua University. In my leisure time, I enjoy playing table tennis.
