Welcome! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science at the University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Ali Anwar](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/ali-anwar). 
My academic background includes a Master's degree in Statistics from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, as well as a Master's and a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Tsinghua University.

My approach to research is uniquely shaped by rich industry experiences across finance, consumer goods, and IT. This multidisciplinary view, forged at the confluence of economics, statistics, and computer science, drives me to formulate and address novel research problems. As generative AI transitions from research labs into a broad array of disciplines and industries, my focus is on AI trustworthiness, encompassing safety moderation, incentive designs, and aligning AI with human values.

I am deeply committed to aligning AI with societal values, aiming for human-centric and trustworthy AI-driven decisions. In my leisure time, I enjoy playing table tennis and participating in community activities.
