title: "A Framework for Incentivized Collaborative Learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-5-01-ICL
excerpt: 'Collaborations among various entities, such as companies, research labs, AI agents,
and edge devices, have become increasingly crucial for achieving machine learning
tasks that cannot be accomplished by a single entity alone. In this work, we establish a novel framework for incentivized
collaborative learning, and provide insights into the critical issue of when and
why incentives can improve collaboration performance. Furthermore, we show the
broad applicability of ICL to specific cases in federated learning, assisted learning,
and multi-armed bandit with both theory and experimental results.'
