title: "Personalized Federated Recommender Systems with Private and Partially Federated AutoEncoders"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-3-01-Recommender
excerpt: 'Recommender Systems (RSs) have become increasingly important in many application domains, such as digital marketing. However, conventional RSs suffer from two critical limitations: the personalization problem that the RSs trained traditionally may not be customized for individual users, and the privacy problem that directly sharing user data is not encouraged. We propose Personalized Federated Recommender Systems (PersonalFR), which introduces a personalized autoencoder-based recommendation model with Federated Learning to address these challenges.'
