title: "Optimization of Spinal Cord Stimulation Using Bayesian Preference Learning and Its Validation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-8-01-Spinal
excerpt: 'Epidural spinal cord stimulation has been
reported to partially restore volitional movement and autonomic functions after motor and sensory-complete spinal
cord injury. In this paper, we present a Bayesian
optimization strategy for identifying personalized optimal
stimulation patterns based on the participantâ€™s expressed
preference for stimulation settings. We present companion validation protocols for investigating the credibility
of learned preference models.'
