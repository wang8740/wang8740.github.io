excerpt: 'Personalized FL has been widely used to cater
to heterogeneity challenges with non-IID data.
A primary obstacle is considering the personalization process from the client’s perspective to
preserve their autonomy. Allowing the clients to
participate in personalized FL decisions becomes
significant due to privacy and security concerns,
where the clients may not be at liberty to share
private information necessary for producing good
quality personalized models. Moreover, clients
with high-quality data and resources are reluctant
to participate in the FL process without reasonable incentive. In this paper, we propose PI-FL, a
one-shot personalization solution complemented
by a token-based incentive mechanism that rewards personalized training. PI-FL outperforms
other state-of-the-art approaches and can generate
good-quality personalized models while respecting clients’ privacy.'
