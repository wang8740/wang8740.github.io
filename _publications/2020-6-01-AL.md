title: "Assisted Learning: A Framework for Multi-Organization Learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-6-01-AL
excerpt: 'In an increasing number of AI scenarios, collaborations among different organizations or agents (e.g., human and robots, mobile units) are often essential to
accomplish an organization-specific mission. However, to avoid leaking useful and
possibly proprietary information, organizations typically enforce stringent security
constraints on sharing modeling algorithms and data, which significantly limits
collaborations. In this work, we introduce the Assisted Learning framework for
organizations to assist each other in supervised learning tasks without revealing
any organizationâ€™s algorithm, data, or even task.'
