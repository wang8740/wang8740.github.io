title: "Information Laundering for Model Privacy"

excerpt: 'In this work, we propose information laundering, a novel framework for enhancing model privacy. Unlike data privacy that concerns the protection of raw data
information, model privacy aims to protect an already-learned model that is to be deployed for public use. The private model can be obtained from general learning
methods, and its deployment means that it will return a deterministic or random response for a given input query. An information-laundered model consists of
probabilistic components that deliberately maneuver the intended input and output for queries of the model, so the modelâ€™s adversarial acquisition is less likely.
Under the proposed framework, we develop an information-theoretic principle to quantify the fundamental tradeoffs between model utility and privacy leakage, and
derive the optimal design.'
